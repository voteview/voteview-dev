Creating migrations
---------------------------

Create a migration by running ``vvtool`` on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ poetry install
   ...

   $ poetry run vvtool --database voteview migration create add_votes



This will create a new migration file under ``migrations``. Write code for doing
the migration upgrade in the ``up`` function and for reverting it in the
``down`` function. See ``0001_trump.py`` for an example.



.. code-block:: python

    """Add initial Trump votes from Congressional Quarterly file."""


    import csv
    import typing as t

    import importlib_resources

    import vvtool.migrations.data


    DATA_FILE = "initial_trump_votes.csv"
    TRUMP_ICPSR = 99912


    def read_votes() -> t.List[t.Dict[str, str]]:
        """Read Trump vote records from the data file."""
        with importlib_resources.open_text(vvtool.migrations.data, DATA_FILE) as file:
            return list(csv.DictReader(file))


    def up(db=None):  # pylint: disable=unused-argument
        """Add initial Trump votes from Congressional Quarterly file."""
        for record in read_votes():
            rollcall = vvtool.Rollcall.objects(rollcall_id=record["VoteviewID"])
            new_vote = {"icpsr": TRUMP_ICPSR, "cast_code": 1}
            rollcall.update_one(push__votes=new_vote)


    def down(db=None):  # pylint: disable=unused-argument
        """Remove initial Trump votes from Congressional Quarterly file."""
        for trump_vote in read_votes():
            rollcall = vvtool.Rollcall.objects(rollcall_id=trump_vote["VoteviewID"])
            new_vote = {"icpsr": TRUMP_ICPSR, "cast_code": 1}
            rollcall.update_one(pull__votes=new_vote)



Also write a test that
it works. See ``test_initial_trump_votes.py`` for an example.


.. code-block:: python

    """Test Trump votes migration."""

    import importlib

    import vvtool


    MIGRATION = importlib.import_module("vvtool.migrations.0001_trump")


    def test_trump_migration(db):
        """The migration appends votes to rollcalls.

        Migrating up adds votes to the selected rollcalls.
        Migrating down removes the votes.
        """

        # Given:
        # The rollcalls on which Trump voted exist.
        for rollcall in MIGRATION.read_votes():
            vvtool.Rollcall(rollcall_id=rollcall["VoteviewID"]).save()

        # Trump has not voted.
        assert list(db.voteview_rollcalls.find({"votes.icpsr": 99912})) == []

        # When:
        # Execute the migration.
        MIGRATION.up()

        # Then:
        # Trump's votes appear in the database.
        assert len(list(db.voteview_rollcalls.find({"votes.icpsr": 99912}))) > 0

        # When:
        # Undo the migration.
        MIGRATION.down()

        # Then:
        # Trump's votes are gone from the database.
        assert list(db.voteview_rollcalls.find({"votes.icpsr": 99912})) == []



To change the date of a rollcall, filter the rollcall objects, and ``update()``
with the new data. In the database, ``id`` is the field containing the
human-readable identifier for rollcalls and members. However, ``mongoengine``
treats ``id`` as a reserved name, so we have to use ``rollcall_id`` instead when
querying through the ``Rollcall.object()`` API.



To run the tests, install docker and run tox.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ poetry run tox



When you're satisfied that the migration works,

* Add your change in the changelog.
* Create a pull request into ``master``.




Execution
-----------

In another terminal, set up ssh forwarding for the staging database server. Plug in the
address or ssh alias of the staging server. Connections to the local MongoDB port will be
forwarded to the remote MongoDB port.


.. code-block:: bash

   % ssh -NL 27017:localhost:27017 "${STAGING_SERVER}"


Find the id number of the migration to execute.

.. code-block:: bash

    % vvtool --host localhost --database=voteview migration status

Note this ``localhost`` is really the staging server because of ssh forwarding.



Run the migration using the id number. For example, to upgrade through migration number
``0001``, run:

.. code-block:: bash

     %  vvtool --host=localhost --database=voteview migration up 1
